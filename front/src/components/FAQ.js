            Ebets is an Ethereum based betting platform.
            The bets are implemented as smart contracts, and you can check them out on our <a href='https://github.com/ethbets/ebets/tree/master/contracts'>GitHub</a>.

            Users may put their money on existing bets or create their own bets. The bets are usually related
            to sports or e-sports, but not necessarily. When the match ends, an arbiter is invoked to decide
            the outcome. The winners are then allowed to collect their rewards.

            Choose a team to bet on, the amount of money you want to bet, and press Bet!
            By default, you are betting in Ether. You can also bet ERC20 tokens by changing the
            currency field to one of the common tokens, or typing the Ethereum address of the token.
            Once you bet on a team, regardless the currency, you are not allowed to bet on the other team.

            The arbiter is the entity that decides the outcome of the bet it is assigned to.
            As the arbiter is seen as an Ethereum address, it may be a person, a group of people,
            a smart contract, an oracle, or many other things. Currently we use the Monarch arbiter
            for our bets, but you can of course use any arbiter of your choice when creating a bet.

            Please keep in mind that we cannot guarantee the quality of the arbiters chosen by users.

            Almost the entire system is controlled by our open source smart contracts,
            available on our <a href='https://github.com/ethbets/ebets/tree/master/contracts'>GitHub</a>.
            The only possible attack against your money, in case a bet uses our Monarchy arbiter,
            is for us to lie about the outcome of a match. For now this is entirely reputation based,
            since one wrong result from us will lead to the fall of Ebets, which we do not want to happen.
            We plan to outsource and build a community of arbiters related to each bet category
            (similar to a justice system, if you will) to improve our system.

            If you win a bet you will have quite a lot of time to collect your rewards (several days).
